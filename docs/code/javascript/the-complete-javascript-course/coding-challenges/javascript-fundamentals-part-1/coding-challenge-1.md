# Coding Challenge #1

Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula:
BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meter).

## Your tasks

1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both versions)
3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.

## Test data

* **Data 1:** Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall.
* **Data 2:** Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 m tall.

**GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€**
