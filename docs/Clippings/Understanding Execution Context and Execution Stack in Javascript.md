## What is an Execution Context?

Simply put, an execution context is an abstract concept of an environment where the Javascript code is evaluated and executed. Whenever any code is run in JavaScript, it’s run inside an execution context.

## Types of Execution Context

There are three types of execution context in JavaScript.

- **Global Execution Context —** This is the default or base execution context. The code that is not inside any function is in the global execution context. It performs two things: it creates a global object which is a window object (in the case of browsers) and sets the value of `this` to equal to the global object. There can only be one global execution context in a program.
- **Functional Execution Context —** Every time a function is invoked, a brand new execution context is created for that function. Each function has its own execution context, but it’s created when the function is invoked or called. There can be any number of function execution contexts. Whenever a new execution context is created, it goes through a series of steps in a defined order which I will discuss later in this article.
- **Eval Function Execution Context —** Code executed inside an `eval `function also gets its own execution context, but as `eval `isn’t usually used by JavaScript developers, so I will not discuss it here.

## Execution Stack

Execution stack, also known as “calling stack” in other programming languages, is a stack with a LIFO (Last in, First out) structure, which is used to store all the execution context created during the code execution.

When the JavaScript engine first encounters your script, it creates a global execution context and pushes it to the current execution stack. Whenever the engine finds a function invocation, it creates a new execution context for that function and pushes it to the top of the stack.

The engine executes the function whose execution context is at the top of the stack. When this function completes, its execution stack is popped off from the stack, and the control reaches to the context below it in the current stack.

Let’s understand this with a code example below:

``` JavaScript
let a = 'Hello World!';function first() {
  console.log('Inside first function');
  second();
  console.log('Again inside first function');
}function second() {
  console.log('Inside second function');
}first();
console.log('Inside Global Execution Context');
```

When the above code loads in the browser, the Javascript engine creates a global execution context and pushes it to the current execution stack. When a call to `first()` is encountered, the Javascript engines creates a new execution context for that function and pushes it to the top of the current execution stack.

When the `second()` function is called from within the `first()` function, the Javascript engine creates a new execution context for that function and pushes it to the top of the current execution stack. When the `second()` function finishes, its execution context is popped off from the current stack, and the control reaches to the execution context below it, that is the `first()` function execution context.

When the `first()` finishes, its execution stack is removed from the stack and control reaches to the global execution context. Once all the code is executed, the JavaScript engine removes the global execution context from the current stack.

## How is the Execution Context created?

Up until now, we have seen how the JavaScript engine manages the execution context, Now let’s understand how an execution context is created by the JavaScript engine.

The execution context is created in two phases: **1) Creation Phase** and **2) Execution Phase.**

## The Creation Phase

The execution context is created during the creation phase. Following things happen during the creation phase:

1. **LexicalEnvironment** component is created.
2. **VariableEnvironment** component is created.

So the execution context can be conceptually represented as follows:

``` JavaScript
ExecutionContext = {
  LexicalEnvironment = <ref. to LexicalEnvironment in memory>,
  VariableEnvironment = <ref. to VariableEnvironment in  memory>,
}
```

## Lexical Environment

The [official ES6](http://ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/) docs define Lexical Environment as

> A *Lexical Environment* is a specification type used to define the association of *Identifiers* to specific variables and functions based upon the lexical nesting structure of ECMAScript code. A Lexical Environment consists of an Environment Record and a possibly null reference to an *outer* Lexical Environment.

Simply put, A *lexical environment* is a structure that holds **identifier-variable mapping**. (here **identifier** refers to the name of variables/functions, and the **variable** is the reference to actual object \[including function object and array object\] or primitive value).

For example, consider the following snippet:

``` JavaScript
var a = 20;
var b = 40;function foo() {
  console.log('bar');
}
```

So the lexical environment for the above snippet looks like this:

``` JavaScript
lexicalEnvironment = {
  a: 20,
  b: 40,
  foo: <ref. to foo function>
}
```

Each Lexical Environment has three components:

1. Environment Record
2. Reference to the outer environment,
3. This binding.

## **Environment Record**

The environment record is the place where the variable and function declarations are stored inside the lexical environment.

There are also two types of *environment record* :

- **Declarative environment record —** As its name suggests stores variable and function declarations. The lexical environment for function code contains a declarative environment record.
- **Object environment record —** The lexical environment for global code contains a objective environment record. Apart from variable and function declarations, the object environment record also stores a global binding object (window object in browsers). So for each of binding object’s property (in case of browsers, it contains properties and methods provided by browser to the window object), a new entry is created in the record.

**Note —** For the **function code**, the *environment record* also contains an `arguments` object that contains the mapping between indexes and arguments passed to the function and the *length(number)* of the arguments passed into the function. For example, an argument object for the below function looks like this:

``` JavaScript
function foo(a, b) {
  var c = a + b;
}
foo(2, 3);// argument object
Arguments: {0: 2, 1: 3, length: 2},
```

## Reference to the Outer Environment

The **reference to the outer environment** means it has access to its outer lexical environment. That means that the JavaScript engine can look for variables inside the outer environment if they are not found in the current lexical environment.

## This Binding

In this component, the value of `this` is determined or set.

In the global execution context, the value of `this` refers to the global object. (in browsers, `this` refers to the Window Object).

In the function execution context, the value of `this` depends on how the function is called. If it is called by an object reference, then the value of `this` is set to that object, otherwise, the value of `this` is set to the global object or `undefined`(in strict mode). For example:

``` JavaScript
const person = {
  name: 'peter',
  birthYear: 1994,
  calcAge: function() {
    console.log(2018 - this.birthYear);
  }
}person.calcAge(); 
// 'this' refers to 'person', because 'calcAge' was called with //'person' object referenceconst calculateAge = person.calcAge;
calculateAge();
// 'this' refers to the global window object, because no object reference was given
```

Abstractly, the lexical environment looks like this in pseudocode:

``` JavaScript
GlobalExectionContext = {
  LexicalEnvironment: {
    EnvironmentRecord: {
      Type: "Object",
      // Identifier bindings go here
    }
    outer: <null>,
    this: <global object>
  }
}FunctionExectionContext = {
  LexicalEnvironment: {
    EnvironmentRecord: {
      Type: "Declarative",
      // Identifier bindings go here
    }
    outer: <Global or outer function environment reference>,
    this: <depends on how function is called>
  }
}
```

## Variable Environment:

It’s also a Lexical Environment whose EnvironmentRecord holds bindings created by *VariableStatements* within this execution context.

As written above, the variable environment is also a lexical environment, So it has all the properties and components of a lexical environment as defined above.

In ES6, one difference between **LexicalEnvironment** component and the **VariableEnvironment** component is that the former is used to store function declaration and variable (`let `and `const`) bindings, while the latter is used to store the variable `(var)` bindings only.

## Execution Phase

In this phase assignments to all those variables are done and the code is finally executed.

## Example

Let’s look at some example to understand the above concepts:

``` JavaScript
let a = 20;
const b = 30;
var c;function multiply(e, f) {
 var g = 20;
 return e * f * g;
}c = multiply(20, 30);
```

When the above code is executed, the JavaScript engine creates a global execution context to execute the global code. So the global execution context will look something like this during the creation phase:

``` JavaScript
GlobalExectionContext = {  LexicalEnvironment: {
    EnvironmentRecord: {
      Type: "Object",
      // Identifier bindings go here
      a: < uninitialized >,
      b: < uninitialized >,
      multiply: < func >
    }
    outer: <null>,
    ThisBinding: <Global Object>
  },  VariableEnvironment: {
    EnvironmentRecord: {
      Type: "Object",
      // Identifier bindings go here
      c: undefined,
    }
    outer: <null>,
    ThisBinding: <Global Object>
  }
}
```

During the execution phase, the variable assignments are done. So the global execution context will look something like this during the execution phase.

``` JavaScript
GlobalExectionContext = {LexicalEnvironment: {
    EnvironmentRecord: {
      Type: "Object",
      // Identifier bindings go here
      a: 20,
      b: 30,
      multiply: < func >
    }
    outer: <null>,
    ThisBinding: <Global Object>
  },VariableEnvironment: {
    EnvironmentRecord: {
      Type: "Object",
      // Identifier bindings go here
      c: undefined,
    }
    outer: <null>,
    ThisBinding: <Global Object>
  }
}
```

When a call to function `multiply(20, 30)` is encountered, a new function execution context is created to execute the function code. So the function execution context will look something like this during the creation phase:

``` JavaScript
FunctionExectionContext = {LexicalEnvironment: {
    EnvironmentRecord: {
      Type: "Declarative",
      // Identifier bindings go here
      Arguments: {0: 20, 1: 30, length: 2},
    },
    outer: <GlobalLexicalEnvironment>,
    ThisBinding: <Global Object or undefined>,
  },VariableEnvironment: {
    EnvironmentRecord: {
      Type: "Declarative",
      // Identifier bindings go here
      g: undefined
    },
    outer: <GlobalLexicalEnvironment>,
    ThisBinding: <Global Object or undefined>
  }
}
```

After this, the execution context goes through the execution phase that means assignments to the variables inside the function are done. So the function execution context will look something like this during the execution phase:

``` JavaScript
FunctionExectionContext = {LexicalEnvironment: {
    EnvironmentRecord: {
      Type: "Declarative",
      // Identifier bindings go here
      Arguments: {0: 20, 1: 30, length: 2},
    },
    outer: <GlobalLexicalEnvironment>,
    ThisBinding: <Global Object or undefined>,
  },VariableEnvironment: {
    EnvironmentRecord: {
      Type: "Declarative",
      // Identifier bindings go here
      g: 20
    },
    outer: <GlobalLexicalEnvironment>,
    ThisBinding: <Global Object or undefined>
  }
}
```

After the function completes, the returned value is stored inside `c`. So the global lexical environment is updated. After that, the global code completes and the program finishes.

**Note —** As you might have noticed that the `let` and `const` defined variables do not have any value associated with them during the creation phase, but `var` defined variables are set to `undefined `.

This is because, during the creation phase, the code is scanned for variable and function declarations, while the function declaration is stored in its entirety in the environment, the variables are initially set to `undefined `(in case of `var`) or remain uninitialized (in case of `let `and `const`).

This is the reason why you can access `var `defined variables before they are declared (though `undefined`) but get a reference error when accessing `let` and `const` variables before they are declared.

This is, what we call hoisting.

**Note —** During the execution phase, if the JavaScript engine couldn’t find the value of `let` variable at the actual place it was declared in the source code, then it will assign it the value of `undefined`.

## Conclusion

So we have discussed how JavaScript programs are executed internally. While it’s not necessary that you learn all these concepts to be an awesome JavaScript developer, having a decent understanding of the above concepts will help you to understand other concepts such as Hoisting, Scope, and Closures more easily and deeply.
